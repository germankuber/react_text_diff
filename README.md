# Text Diff Tool

A React-based text comparison tool that highlights differences between two texts at the sentence level.

## Features

- üìù **Sentence-level comparison**: Compares texts sentence by sentence (split by periods, question marks, and exclamation marks)
- üéØ **Precise highlighting**: Only highlights the specific sentences that differ between the two texts
- üìÑ **Format preservation**: Maintains original line breaks and text structure
- üé® **Visual feedback**: Different sentences are highlighted in yellow for easy identification
- ‚ö° **Real-time comparison**: Compare texts instantly with the click of a button

## How it Works

1. **Input**: Enter your original text in the first textarea
2. **Input**: Enter your modified text in the second textarea  
3. **Compare**: Click the "Compare" button to analyze differences
4. **Review**: The tool displays the modified text with differences highlighted in yellow

The tool splits text by sentence boundaries (`.`, `!`, `?`) and compares each sentence individually. Only sentences that differ between the original and modified text will be highlighted.

## Example

**Original Text:**
```
Hello, how are you?
I am testing something different. But I want to know if it works or not.
What do you think?
```

**Modified Text:**
```
Hello, how are you?
I am testing something else. But I want to know if it works or not.
What do you think?
```

**Result:** Only "I am testing something else." will be highlighted in yellow.
